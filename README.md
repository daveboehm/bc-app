This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.

## Local Installation Instructions

1. clone the repo `$ git clone github.com/daveboehm:git/bc-app`
2. `$ cd bc-app`
3. `$ npm i && npm run dev`
4. In a browser, goto [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/)
5. Read my comments there if you'd like, then click the "Go To App" button
6. ???
7. Profit

## Running tests

1. Install the app as described above
2. run `$ npm run test` to run everything in the `/tests` dir
3. For coverage, run `$ npm run test:cov`, visit `file:///{{your-local-dir}}/bc-app/coverage/lcov-report/index.html` Please note I did not attempt to hit a coverage threshold, so this will look bad
